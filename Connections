Connect the 7-segment display to the Arduino using resistors to limit current. Each segment of the display will be connected to a digital pin on the Arduino.
Connect the push buttons to the Arduino for setting the hours and minutes. One button will increment the hours, and the other will increment the minutes.
If using an RTC module, connect it to the Arduino via the I2C interface (SDA and SCL pins).
